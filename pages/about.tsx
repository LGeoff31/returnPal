            ReturnPal focuses on sustainability and community empowerment, that
            is why weâ€™re minimizing waste by partnering with companies and
            agencies like Play Forever to redistribute unsold or unused returns.
            The returns are sorted, refurbished if needed, and redistributed to
            various communities in need.
