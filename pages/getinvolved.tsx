          ReturnPal focuses on sustainability and community empowerment, that is
          why weâ€™re minimizing waste by partnering with companies and agencies
          like Play Forever to redistribute unsold or unused returns. The
          returns are sorted, refurbished if needed, and redistributed to
          various communities in need.
